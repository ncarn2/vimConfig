# NeoVim Config
## This has been migrated to my dotfiles, I may update this repo to still contain my vim config settings and have dotfiles grab from here...


If you want to use this vim configuration, you will need to install `git` and [vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim). After installing these, clone this into your home directory (`~/`).



~~1. Clone this directory to your home directory.

~~git clone git@github.com:ncarn2/vimConfig.git ~/.vim

~~2. Move the file to .vim

~~mv vimconfig ~/.vim


~~3. Install the plugins with vundle

~~vim +PlugInstall
