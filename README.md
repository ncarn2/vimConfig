# NeoVim Config

## This is broken while I switch to neovim and a dotfile manager
## Introduction 
If you want to use this vim configuration, you will need to install `git` and [vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim). After installing these, clone this into your home directory (`~/`).

## Installation

1. Clone this directory to your home directory.
```
git clone git@github.com:ncarn2/vimConfig.git ~/.vim
```
2. Move the file to .vim
```
mv vimconfig ~/.vim
```

3. Install the plugins with vundle
```
vim +PlugInstall 
```
